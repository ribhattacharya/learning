- [1. Single Responsibility](#1-single-responsibility)
- [2. Open/closed](#2-openclosed)

## 1. Single Responsibility
1. Class should have only 1 reason to change
2. Help maintainability
   - Modules remain focused
   - Impact of changes is limited
3. Reusability
   - Smaller modules

## 2. Open/closed
1. Open for extension, closed for modification
2. Add new functionality without changing existing code
3. Hide info behind abstract interfaces instead of differentiating logic inside a class (take advantage of dynamic dispatch instead of switch statements/if conditions).
4. Help maintainability
   - Modules remain focused
   - Impact of changes is limited
5. Reusability
   - Smaller modules
